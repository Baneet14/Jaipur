            <!-- Etymology -->
            <h3 class="history-heading2">Etymology</h3>
            <p class="history-para">
              The name "Jaipur" has an interesting etymology. It is derived from two words: "Jai" and "Pur." 
              <br>

              1. <b>Jai</b>: "Jai" is a reference to Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of the city. He was a prominent ruler of the Kachwaha Rajput dynasty.
              <br>
              2. <b>Pur</b>: "Pur" is a Sanskrit word meaning "city" or "town." 
              
              When combined, "Jai" and "Pur" form "Jaipur," which literally translates to "City of Jai." This name was chosen to honor Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who played a crucial role in the establishment and development of the city.

             <h3>History:</h3> 

              Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II of the Kachwaha Rajput dynasty.
              Maharaja Jai Singh II decided to establish a new capital due to population growth and water scarcity in nearby Amber.
              The city was meticulously planned according to the principles of Shilpa Shastra (Indian architecture), with wide streets and symmetrical layouts.
              Known as the "Pink City" after it was painted pink in 1876 to welcome the Prince of Wales.
              Jaipur played a significant role as a princely state under British colonial rule until India gained independence in 1947.
              </p>

             <h3> Administration:</h3>

Jaipur serves as the capital city of the Indian state of Rajasthan.
The city is governed by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC), which oversees local administration, infrastructure development, and public services.
The JMC is headed by a Mayor and comprises elected representatives from various wards of the city.
Jaipur is divided into administrative zones, each managed by a zonal commissioner who reports to the Municipal Commissioner.
The Rajasthan state government also plays a role in the administration of Jaipur, especially in matters of urban planning, law enforcement, and major infrastructure projects.
